Hello everybody ,

I am Adrian ,


This is my first project,

It is called "The Monkees"

For creating this site I was used the files gived by the Code Institute team (audio,video,pictures)

I have writed all the code in Cloud9 9 environment (Thank you Cloud9 team) :

     ,-----.,--.                  ,--. ,---.   ,--.,------.  ,------.
    '  .--./|  | ,---. ,--.,--. ,-|  || o   \  |  ||  .-.  \ |  .---'
    |  |    |  || .-. ||  ||  |' .-. |`..'  |  |  ||  |  \  :|  `--, 
    '  '--'\|  |' '-' ''  ''  '\ `-' | .'  /   |  ||  '--'  /|  `---.

Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started, create some files, play with the terminal,
or visit http://docs.c9.io for our documentation.
If you want, you can also go watch some training videos at
http://www.youtube.com/user/c9ide.

Happy coding!
The Cloud9 IDE team


I also used the knowledge of HTML and CSS provided to me by the Code Institute Team (Thank you Code Institue Team )

I was using the boostrap for the multitude of preseted elements, fontawsome for the nice icons and cloudflare for nice hover effects.

The Project contains the info for The Monkees rock band.

The info was taken from wikipedia.com -->> The Monkees page and added to my site.

Also all the media buttons links are to The Monkees official media and social links. 

I have tested the functionality of the website on Cloud9 environment and also I have made it to work as gitHub page too.

I hope you all enjoy my project .

Keep coding to make more intresting web-pages and applications .
