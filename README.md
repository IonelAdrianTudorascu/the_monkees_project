**For the UX design process, I used an application called Widows Paint, to transfer my drawings to digital format for illustration. These are included in the [mockup_files](https://github.com/IonelAdrianTudorascu/the_monkees_project/tree/master/Media/mockup_files) folder. The UX design process allowed me to consider the requirements for the website - for example, how and what content was to be presented on the website that was relevant for the visitors.**

* I wanted the website to be intuitive to use and navigate, so I created a navigation bar that held all the pages. The bar also indicates the current location on the website that you are on.

* The website also provides a footer with links to the social websites of The Monkees. I wanted this, to portray that the website is a community website, linked to other resources.

* As someone new to the website or less familiar with The Monkees, I wanted to give some information about The Monkees, which is displayed on the home page ([index.html](https://ioneladriantudorascu.github.io/the_monkees_project/)) and on the media page ([media.html](https://ioneladriantudorascu.github.io/the_monkees_project/media.html)).

* The website also shows a group of pictures of the band members  and a list of their songs and albums in chronological order showed in media page([media.html](https://ioneladriantudorascu.github.io/the_monkees_project/media.html)).

## *The website is structurated as a 5 pages site and you can see on the links below for the mockup files and the actual pages of the site* 


 ### 1. Home page [mockup](https://github.com/IonelAdrianTudorascu/the_monkees_project/blob/master/Media/mockup_files/Home_page.jpg) and the page [index.html](https://ioneladriantudorascu.github.io/the_monkees_project/)
